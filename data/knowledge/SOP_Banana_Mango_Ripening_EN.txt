SOP for Handling and Ripening Bananas and Mangoes (Unripe vs. Ripe)
Document: SOP-QC-RIP-01 | Version: 1.0 | Date: 2025-12-16
Scope: Warehouse/packing house, cold chain, ripening chamber, distribution

1. Purpose
To ensure consistent quality and safe handling of bananas and mangoes across the supply
chain by controlling temperature, relative humidity (RH), ethylene exposure,
ventilation/CO₂, and gentle handling for two conditions: unripe (green/near-mature) and ripe
(ready-to-market).

2. Definitions
Unripe: Firm, green/near-mature fruit suitable for transport and controlled ripening. Ripe:
Softer fruit ready for sale; more sensitive to bruising and temperature fluctuations.
Ripening chamber: A controlled room where ripening is accelerated using ethylene along with
set temperature, RH, and ventilation to manage CO₂ and remove ethylene after treatment.

3. Roles and Responsibilities
QC/Inspector: Incoming inspection, grading decisions (ripen/hold/reject), documentation.
Ripening Operator: Run ripening cycles (setpoints for temperature/RH/ethylene/ventilation)
and monitor readings. Warehouse/Logistics: Maintain cold chain, segregation rules, safe
stacking/handling, FEFO dispatch for ripe fruit.

4. Operational Procedure

4.1 Incoming Receiving and Initial Sorting (Banana & Mango)
1) Verify lot identity: supplier, lot/batch ID, arrival date/time, quantity, packaging
condition. 2) Perform rapid visual QC (sampling): bruising, cuts, mold/rot, leakage (mango
sap), crown damage (banana). 3) Categorize lot:    - Unripe (eligible for controlled
ripening/transport): not extremely immature and not overly mature.    - Ripe/near-ripe:
prioritize for quick dispatch; minimize re-handling. 4) Record findings with photos for
HOLD/REJECT cases (optional but recommended).

4.2 Storage and Transport (Unripe vs. Ripe)
General (especially for unripe): - Pre-cool where feasible and keep temperature stable
throughout transit. - Avoid mixing commodities with incompatible temperature requirements.
Ethylene segregation (critical for unripe bananas and mangoes): - Do not store/transport
unripe bananas/mangoes together with strong ethylene-producing commodities (e.g., apples,
avocados). Use separate zones/vehicles where possible.  Ripe fruit: - Handle gently; limit
stack height; reduce shocks; dispatch quickly using strict FIFO/FEFO.

4.3 Controlled Ripening in a Ripening Chamber
Target RH during ripening: 90–95%. Use commodity-specific setpoints and ensure
ventilation/exhaust to manage CO₂ and remove ethylene after treatment.

4.3.1 Ripening Setpoints (Quick Reference)
Banana: - Ethylene: 100–150 ppm - Exposure time: 24–48 hours - Ripening temperature: 15–18°C
- Post-ripening storage temperature: 13–14°C  Mango: - Ethylene: 100 ppm - Exposure time:
~24 hours - Ripening temperature: 20–22°C - Post-ripening storage temperature: 10–13°C

4.3.2 Ventilation and CO₂ Control
- Maintain CO₂ at a low level throughout ripening; as a practical guide, keep CO₂ below 5000
ppm. - Use exhaust/ventilation to:   (a) remove ethylene after the exposure period, and
(b) prevent CO₂ build-up that can delay ripening or degrade quality.

4.3.3 Step-by-Step Ripening Cycle (Operator)
1) Pre-check: cleanliness, door seals, sensor calibration (temperature/RH/CO₂). 2) Load
fruit: allow airflow paths; avoid dead zones; do not over-stack. 3) Stabilize room: reach
target temperature/RH before ethylene introduction. 4) Ethylene exposure: run for the
specified duration. 5) Ventilate after exposure: purge ethylene and reduce CO₂. 6) Holding:
keep fruit at the appropriate temperature until target ripeness is reached. 7) Record all
readings and deviations; apply corrective action if ripening becomes non-uniform.

4.3.4 Safety Notes (Ethylene Handling)
- Prefer safer delivery methods (cartridges/generators) and trained personnel. - Ensure
ventilation between loads and follow facility safety rules for gases and electrical
equipment.


4.4 Post-Ripening QC and Dispatch
1) Move fruit to post-ripening storage temperatures:    - Banana: 13–14°C    - Mango:
10–13°C 2) Final QC sampling: color stage, firmness (relative), bruising, rot, lot
uniformity. 3) Label status: READY-TO-DISPATCH vs. HOLD (extend holding 12–24h if needed).
4) Dispatch: strict FEFO for ripe lots; minimize handling during loading.


5. Monitoring Checklist (Minimum)
- Lot ID, supplier, arrival date/time - Initial category: UNRIPE / RIPE - Storage and
transit temperatures (where applicable) - Ripening setpoints (T, RH, ethylene ppm, duration)
- CO₂ readings during ripening (keep < 5000 ppm as a guide) - Final QC outcomes and dispatch
decision - Deviations and corrective actions
